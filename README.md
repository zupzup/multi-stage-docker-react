# multi-stage-docker-react

A practical example of using Docker Multi-Stage builds with a React Single Page Application which was created with `create-react-app`.

Build using:

```bash
docker build -t react-test .
```

Run using:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 react-test
```

Go to http://localhost:8080/
